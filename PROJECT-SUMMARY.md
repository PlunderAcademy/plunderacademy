## How It Works

### 1. **Structured Learning Path: The Treasure Map**

Learners navigate through **5 legendary islands**, each representing a stage in their EVM development journey:

- **Island 1: Jungle Island** 🌴 → Blockchain fundamentals, EVM basics, Solidity syntax, ERC-20 tokens
- **Island 2: Frost Peak** ❄️ → Advanced Solidity, security patterns, testing, staking contracts
- **Island 3: Desert Bluff** 🏜️ → NFT standards, ERC-721 implementation, collection deployment
- **Island 4: Gilded Bastion** 🏰 → DeFi patterns, proxy contracts, gas optimization, upgradeability
- **Island 5: Neon Haven** 🌆 → Full-stack dApp development, contract interactions, production deployments

**Structure:**
- 22 core modules
- 70+ interactive lessons
- 20-40 hour total duration
- Self-paced learning

### 2. **Interactive Learning Elements**

Each module includes:
- **Quizzes:** Multiple choice, multiple select, interactive puzzles (word jumbles, concept matching, timeline builders)
- **Deployment Challenges:** Real contract deployments on Zilliqa testnet/mainnet
- **Missions:** Narrative storytelling that guides learning
- **Hands-on Practice:** Write code, deploy contracts, verify transactions

### 3. **AI-Powered Learning Arsenal**

#### **AI Solidity Reviewer** (`/reviewer`)

- **Features:**
  - Detects vulnerabilities (reentrancy, unchecked calls, etc.)
  - Suggests gas optimizations
  - Security-focused analysis
  - Real-time feedback
- **Use Case:** Review code before deployment, learn security best practices

#### **Wise Oracle Chat** (`/chat`)

- **Features:**
  - Context-aware answers (knows Zilliqa EVM specifics)
  - Code examples with explanations
  - Security warnings for common pitfalls
  - 24/7 availability
- **Use Case:** Ask questions, get instant guidance, debug issues

### 4. **On-Chain Achievements (NFTs)**

- **How It Works:**
  1. Learner completes a module/quiz
  2. Achievement NFT is minted to their wallet
  3. Verifiable on-chain proof of completion
  4. Shareable credentials (portfolio, job applications)
  
- **Examples:**
  - "The Molten Mountain" → Solidity mastery
  - "The Woolly Mammoth" → Staking contract deployment
  - "The Gilded Vault" → DeFi pattern mastery

**Total:** 20+ unique achievement NFTs across 5 islands

### 5. **Production-Ready Deployments**

Unlike toy examples, learners build and deploy:
- **ERC-20 Token Factory:** Deploy custom tokens on Zilliqa testnet/mainnet
- **Staking Contracts:** Real deposits, withdrawals, reward logic
- **NFT Collections:** Minting, metadata, marketplace integration
- **Full-Stack dApps:** Next.js frontend + smart contracts + wallet integration

### 6. **Technical Stack**

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Web3:** wagmi v2, RainbowKit, viem v2 (Zilliqa chain support)
