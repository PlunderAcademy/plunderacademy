# Module 2: Advanced NFT Features - Quiz

## Questions

### Question 1
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.4 Metadata Standards and IPFS Integration

**Options:**
- A) https://gateway.example.com/collection/
- B) ipfs:// URIs on-chain
- C) data: URIs for all JSON and images
- D) ftp:// URIs served by the project

### Question 2
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.4 Metadata Standards and IPFS Integration

Which signals should a contract (or companion) emit to tell indexers that metadata changed and must be re-fetched?

**Options:**
- A) Transfer
- B) ApprovalForAll
- C) BaseURISet only
- D) ERC-4906 MetadataUpdate / BatchMetadataUpdate

---

### Question 3
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.4 Metadata Standards and IPFS Integration

Which statement best describes deterministic tokenURI design after reveal?

**Options:**
- A) The same tokenId always resolves to the same path for every viewer; changes are signaled via events
- B) tokenURI varies by msg.sender to personalize content
- C) tokenURI rotates gateways per request to avoid rate-limits
- D) tokenURI appends random query params to force cache refreshes

---

### Question 4
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.4 Metadata Standards and IPFS Integration

Why pin JSON and media across multiple IPFS providers?

**Options:**
- A) To reduce on-chain gas for _baseURI
- B) To increase royalty enforcement across marketplaces
- C) To ensure availability and durability if one provider or gateway fails
- D) To eliminate the need for a provenance hash

---

### Question 5
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.5 Reveal Mechanics and Royalty Standards

What does ERC-2981 primarily provide for NFT collections?

**Options:**
- A) Guaranteed enforcement of royalties on every marketplace
- B) Automatic on-chain distribution of secondary sale proceeds
- C) A standard interface reporting royalty receiver and amount; enforcement is marketplace-dependent
- D) A mandatory fixed 10% royalty for all tokens

### Question 6
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.5 Reveal Mechanics and Royalty Standards

Which is the recommended approach for fair, audit-friendly reveals?

**Options:**
- A) A single atomic switch from hidden placeholder to final base CID
- B) Per-token reveals over several days
- C) Viewer-dependent reveals based on wallet address
- D) Multiple random base URIs chosen at request time

---

### Question 7
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.5 Reveal Mechanics and Royalty Standards

Why publish a provenance hash before mint?

**Options:**
- A) To compress metadata files for cheaper storage
- B) To pre-commit to media ordering/content and discourage manipulation accusations
- C) To speed up tokenURI resolution in wallets
- D) To define the default royalty receiver on-chain

---

### Question 8
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.5 Reveal Mechanics and Royalty Standards

Which royalty configuration aligns with typical marketplace limits and best practice?

**Options:**
- A) 25% (2500 bps) minimum to ensure creator revenue
- B) 0% only, because royalties are never honored
- C) No limit; set any percentage and expect universal enforcement
- D) ≤10% commonly, prefer 2.5–7.5% (250–750 bps) and document policy

---

### Question 9
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.6 Multi-Phase Minting Concepts

What should contracts do on every mint phase transition?

**Options:**
- A) Update tokenURI for all tokens
- B) Emit a PhaseChanged(phase) event for auditability and frontends
- C) Emit Minted events for all prior minters
- D) Transfer one token to the admin to mark the phase

### Question 10
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.6 Multi-Phase Minting Concepts

How do Merkle proofs enable scalable allowlists for presales?

**Options:**
- A) By storing the entire allowlist array on-chain
- B) By letting any address mint without verification
- C) By relying on signature strings uploaded to IPFS
- D) By verifying a short proof against an on-chain Merkle root

---

### Question 11
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.6 Multi-Phase Minting Concepts

What is a gas-predictable pattern to enforce per-wallet mint caps?

**Options:**
- A) Track mints in mapping(address => uint256) and perform O(1) checks before mint
- B) Iterate over the buyer’s entire purchase history on-chain each mint
- C) Query past Transfer events in the same transaction
- D) Require an off-chain server to track per-wallet usage

### Question 12
**Type:** Multiple Choice  
**Points:** 6  
**Lesson:** 3.6 Multi-Phase Minting Concepts

Which approach provides robust safety for payable mints that call external code?

**Options:**
- A) Prefer require strings over custom errors
- B) Rely on _safeMint without additional guards
- C) Follow CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) and add nonReentrant
