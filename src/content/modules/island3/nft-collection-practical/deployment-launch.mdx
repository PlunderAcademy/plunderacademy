# NFT Collection Deployment and Launch

## Set the stage

Time to stitch the pieces together: ERC721 core, IPFS metadata + reveal, ERC‑2981 royalties, and multi‑phase minting. We’ll focus on clear initialization, admin safety, and event contracts that make launches observable.

## Core ideas

- Deterministic initialization: owner/roles, baseURIs, royalty config, supply caps
- Phase switches emit events; on‑chain state mirrors public announcements
- Minimal on‑chain complexity; push analytics off‑chain via stable events

## Hands‑on

### 1) Launch checklist (what to encode/tests)

```md
- Owner/admin set and documented
- BaseURI placeholder set; reveal plan documented
- Default royalty (ERC‑2981) set to receiver with fee bps
- Phase = Closed; price/maxPerWallet configured
- Pausable verified; incident runbook linked
```

Takeaway: encode assumptions as tests or scripts to prevent human error.

### 2) Post‑deploy verification script (outline)

```ts
// scripts/verifyLaunch.ts (outline)
import { expect } from "chai";

export async function verify(core: any, admin: string) {
  expect(await core.owner?.()).to.equal(admin);
  // Expect placeholder tokenURI for token 0 (if minted in tests)
  // Expect royalty info for a sample sale price
}
```

Takeaway: quick assertions catch misconfigurations immediately after deploy.

## Practice and reflection

- Draft your public announcement events (phase changes, reveal) and confirm they’re emitted
- List what you’ll monitor during mint: errors, gas, event counts, wallet limits

## Wrap‑up

Your collection is wired for a safe launch: deterministic init, reveal/royalties, and phase controls. Next, validate end‑to‑end with integration/testing.
