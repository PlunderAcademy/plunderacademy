"At dawn, the capstone glows, and the collection awakens."

Beyond the kasbah lies a pyramid half-buried in time — The Mound of Morning.

This is where creation ascends to completeness. You gather every lesson from the desert and bring them together into a living NFT collection.

When your deployment completes, the pyramid awakens. Each NFT becomes a star at dawn.
