"At dawn, the capstone glows, and the collection awakens."

Beyond the kasbah rises a pyramid half-buried in time: the Mound of Morning.  
Here, creation reaches completion.  

You gather every desert lesson into one collection.  
When deployment completes, the pyramid stirs.  
Each NFT becomes a star at dawn.
