Within the Garden Ruins, code itself breathes and adapts. Each contract you deploy here is alive — upgradeable, resilient, and bound to evolve without breaking. As you walk among the crumbling walls, you restore continuity and strengthen logic, ensuring that your creations endure through time, ready to update and renew whenever the future demands.
