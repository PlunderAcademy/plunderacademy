"Truth travels slower than rumor, but it never lies."

The Castle’s bazaar hums with voices.  
Some speak truth. Others twist it.  

You learn to summon data from the world beyond the chain.  
Oracles deliver proof. Randomness becomes order.  

Each call brings clarity.  
Each response brings precision.  
The market begins to trust you.
