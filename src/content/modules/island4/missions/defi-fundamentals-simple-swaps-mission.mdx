"Guard the flow, and the flow guards you."

At the Watchers Gate, sentinels stand over the current of liquidity.  
Pools fill and empty with every trade.  
You learn to read their rhythm.  

Ratios, reserves, and fees move together like tides.  
Balance is never still.  
You learn to keep the current alive.
