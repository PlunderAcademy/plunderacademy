**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.1 Token Economics and Liquidity Concepts

### Question 3
**Type:** Multiple Select
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.1 Token Economics and Liquidity Concepts

Which are true about slippage protection and deadlines?

**Options:**
- A) `minOut` causes the transaction to revert if actual output is too low
- B) `minOut` increases the output when price moves unfavorably
- C) Deadlines automatically extend during network congestion
- D) A deadline check should revert when `block.timestamp` exceeds the provided value

**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.2 Simple Swap Mechanics and Security

Which order reflects the CEI discipline for value‑moving functions?

**Options:**
- A) Interactions → Effects → Checks
- B) Checks → Interactions → Effects
- C) Effects → Checks → Interactions

### Question 5
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.2 Simple Swap Mechanics and Security

Why use OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20` in swap routers?

**Options:**
- A) It handles non‑standard ERC‑20 return values and reverts on failure
- B) It allows transfers without prior approvals
- C) It automatically refunds gas on token transfers
- D) It disables revert conditions to maximize throughput

### Question 6
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.2 Simple Swap Mechanics and Security

What is a good observability practice for swaps?

**Options:**
- A) Emit multiple small events per swap to minimize gas
- B) Omit events—state queries are sufficient for analytics
- C) Emit a single `Swapped` event with indexed trader and token addresses and numeric amounts
- D) Index all numeric values to make logs smaller

### Question 7
**Type:** Timeline Builder
**Points:** 8
**Lesson:** 4.2 Simple Swap Mechanics and Security

Arrange the swap execution steps in the correct order.

**Interactive Data:**
```json
{
  "events": [
    {"id": "evt-1", "text": "Read reserves from pair"},
    {"id": "evt-2", "text": "Orient reserves based on tokenIn/token0"},
    {"id": "evt-3", "text": "Compute amountOut with feeBps"},
    {"id": "evt-4", "text": "Check minOut and (optional) deadline"},
    {"id": "evt-5", "text": "Transfer tokenIn to pair (SafeERC20)"},
    {"id": "evt-6", "text": "Call pair.swap(...) to send tokenOut"}
  ]
}
```

### Question 8
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.1 Token Economics and Liquidity Concepts

How should differing token decimals be handled when computing quotes?

**Options:**
- A) Assume all ERC‑20 tokens use 18 decimals
- B) Only UIs need normalization; on‑chain math can ignore decimals
- C) Chainlink prices always use 18 decimals, so normalization is unnecessary
- D) Normalize values to a consistent internal scale before arithmetic

### Question 9
**Type:** Multiple Select
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.1 Token Economics and Liquidity Concepts

Which statements are correct about constant product AMMs?

**Options:**
- A) Price impact grows non‑linearly with trade size
- B) Using stale reserves is safe for batch swaps
- C) Fees are taken from the input before computing output
- D) Outputs can assume `tokenIn` is always `token0`

### Question 10
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.2 Simple Swap Mechanics and Security

What is the purpose of a `deadline` parameter in swaps?

**Options:**
- A) Informational only; it doesn’t affect execution
- B) Force a revert if the transaction executes after the specified time
- C) Measure freshness in block numbers only
- D) It harms composability and should be avoided

### Question 11
**Type:** Concept Matching
**Points:** 8
**Lesson:** 4.1 Token Economics and Liquidity Concepts

Match each concept to its description.

**Interactive Data:**
```json
{
  "concepts": [
    {"id": "c1", "text": "constant product"},
    {"id": "c2", "text": "minOut"},
    {"id": "c3", "text": "fee (bps)"}
  ],
  "definitions": [
    {"id": "d1", "text": "x·y=k pricing; impact grows with trade size"},
    {"id": "d2", "text": "Caller’s minimum acceptable output to cap slippage"},
    {"id": "d3", "text": "Per‑trade fee in parts per 10,000"}
  ]
}
```

### Question 12
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.2 Simple Swap Mechanics and Security

How do you orient input/output reserves when computing `amountOut`?

**Options:**
- A) Compare `tokenIn` to `pair.token0()`; map input/output reserves accordingly
- B) Always treat `r0` as the input reserve
- C) Orientation doesn’t matter; the math is symmetric
- D) `token0` can change post‑deployment, so orientation is dynamic
