### Question 1
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.3 Oracle Problem and Chainlink Integration

Which local validation should be performed when reading a price feed?

**Options:**
- A) Only check that `answer != 0`
- B) Normalize decimals and ensure `answer > 0` and `updatedAt` within `maxAge`
- C) Skip staleness checks for gas savings
- D) Assume 18‑decimals for all feeds
---

### Question 2
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.3 Oracle Problem and Chainlink Integration

What is the typical purpose of a deviation guard (e.g., `maxDeviationBps`)?

**Options:**
- A) Automatically average prices from two feeds
- B) Reject updates that move too far from the last accepted price
- C) Force prices to increase monotonically
- D) Convert prices to 1e18 units

### Question 3
**Type:** Multiple Select
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.3 Oracle Problem and Chainlink Integration

Which are recommended when integrating oracles?

**Options:**
- A) Emit events when pausing due to deviation
- B) Fail open when stale to preserve UX
- C) Expose `maxAge` and feed addresses for observability
- D) Auto‑switch to any available backup feed silently

### Question 4
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.4 Commit-Reveal Sequences and Verifiable Randomness

Why is `blockhash` alone insufficient for randomness?

**Options:**
- A) It is too random and expensive
- B) Validators can influence or withhold blocks
- C) It is unavailable in Solidity
- D) It reveals private keys
---

### Question 5
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.4 Commit-Reveal Sequences and Verifiable Randomness

What does binding commitments to `msg.sender` and a salt achieve?

**Options:**
- A) Prevents modulo bias
- B) Prevents commitment theft and cross‑round replay
- C) Ensures single‑transaction UX
- D) Removes need for reveal phase
---

### Question 6
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.4 Commit-Reveal Sequences and Verifiable Randomness

Which comparison between commit–reveal and VRF is accurate?

**Options:**
- A) Commit–reveal requires an oracle subscription; VRF does not
- B) Commit–reveal is two‑phase and permissionless; VRF is single‑phase with oracle proofs
- C) Both provide on‑chain proofs of randomness
- D) VRF is permissionless and commit–reveal needs a coordinator

### Question 7
**Type:** True/False Statements
**Points:** 8
**Lesson:** 4.4 Commit-Reveal Sequences and Verifiable Randomness

Classify each statement as true or false.

**Interactive Data:**
```json
{
  "statements": [
    {"id":"s1","text":"Using blockhash alone is secure entropy for lotteries"},
    {"id":"s2","text":"Salting commitments with msg.sender reduces commit theft"},
    {"id":"s3","text":"VRF provides a verifiable proof on-chain"},
    {"id":"s4","text":"Modulo bias can be ignored for small ranges"}
  ]
}
```

### Question 8
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.5 Efficient Airdrop and Distribution Mechanisms

Why prefer Merkle proofs for large public airdrops?

**Options:**
- A) Proofs are generated on-chain for each claimant
- B) Gas cost is centralized to the deployer
- C) Users prove inclusion with logarithmic‑size proofs; deployer stores only a root
- D) It eliminates the need for events
---

### Question 9
**Type:** Multiple Select
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.5 Efficient Airdrop and Distribution Mechanisms

Which are benefits of bitmap replay protection?

**Options:**
- A) Packs 256 claim flags per storage slot
- B) Requires per‑address boolean mappings
- C) Prevents duplicate claims by index
- D) Eliminates the need for proofs
---

### Question 10
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.3 Oracle Problem and Chainlink Integration

How should feed decimals be handled?

**Options:**
- A) Assume 8 decimals for all USD pairs and skip normalization
- B) Immediately normalize to 1e18 or a consistent internal unit
- C) Normalize only for UI display; on‑chain math can mix units
- D) Convert to 1e6 to match USDC
---

### Question 11
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.5 Efficient Airdrop and Distribution Mechanisms

What should airdrop manifests include to enable independent verification?

**Options:**
- A) Only the Merkle root; details are optional
- B) Full recipient list, leaf schema, tree generator version, and root
- C) Contract bytecode
- D) Private keys used for generation
---

### Question 12
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 4.4 Commit-Reveal Sequences and Verifiable Randomness

How do you eliminate modulo bias when mapping randomness to `0..n-1`?

**Options:**
- A) Use `rnd % n` directly; bias is negligible
- B) Round to nearest multiple of `n`
- C) Rejection sampling: discard values in the biased zone, rehash, and retry
- D) Use block.timestamp as a tiebreaker
