## Defining Functions

Functions are the interface for users and contracts to interact with your smart contract.

```solidity
function multiply(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {
    return a * b;
}
```

- `public` means anyone can call this function externally
- `private`/`internal` restrict calls to the contract itself or derived contracts
- `view` functions read state without modifying it
- `pure` functions neither read nor write state

### Access Control Patterns

To secure sensitive operations, modifiers enforce access restrictions:

```solidity
address public owner;

modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
    _;
}

function changeGreeting(string calldata newGreeting) public onlyOwner {
    greeting = newGreeting;
}
```

`msg.sender` is the caller's address, and combining this with modifiers restricts function execution to designated owners or roles.
