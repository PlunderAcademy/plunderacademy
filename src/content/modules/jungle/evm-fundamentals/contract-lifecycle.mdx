## Phases of a Contract's Life

1. **Write:** Code is authored in Solidity
2. **Compile:** Translation into EVM bytecode and the ABI interface
3. **Deploy:** Bytecode is sent as a transaction creating the contract on-chain; deployment consumes gas
4. **Interact:** Users or other contracts send transactions or calls to invoke functions
5. **Update:** Contracts can be upgraded via proxy patterns or redeployment

### Deployment Details

The deployment transaction carries initialization data, resulting in a contract address once mined. This address becomes the persistent locator allowing interaction with the deployed logic and state.
