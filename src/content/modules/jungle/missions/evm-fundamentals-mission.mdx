Mission 2: The Jungle Village

You leave the shipwreck behind and arrive at a village perched above the water on wooden stilts. Palm trees sway overhead and lanterns glow softly as villagers move purposefully along walkways connecting huts and hammocks. This close-knit community thrives on cooperation and precision, much like the Ethereum Virtual Machine that powers decentralized applications.

Here, your task is to understand the EVM's complex system—how code is executed, gas fuels operations, contracts are created and destroyed, and which tools developers use to build and maintain this ecosystem. Mastering these concepts prepares you to journey further into the blockchain world.
