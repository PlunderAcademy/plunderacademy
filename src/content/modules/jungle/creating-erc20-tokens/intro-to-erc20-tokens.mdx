## Understanding ERC-20 Tokens

### What Is the ERC-20 Standard?

**Real-world analogy:** Think of ERC-20 like a universal standard for coins in an arcade. Just as every arcade game accepts the same standard tokens, every wallet, exchange, and dApp can work with any ERC-20 token because they all follow the same interface rules.

**ERC-20 is the most important token standard** on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains like Zilliqa. It defines a common interface that ensures any compliant token can be:
- **Stored** in any wallet that supports the standard
- **Traded** on any decentralized exchange
- **Used** by any DeFi protocol or dApp
- **Tracked** by any block explorer or portfolio app

### Why ERC-20 Matters for Developers

**Universal compatibility:** When you build an ERC-20 token, you automatically gain compatibility with the entire DeFi ecosystem:
- **Wallets:** MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, hardware wallets
- **Exchanges:** Uniswap, SushiSwap, 1inch, and centralized exchanges
- **DeFi protocols:** Lending platforms, yield farms, liquidity pools
- **Analytics:** CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, DeFiLlama integration

## The ERC-20 Interface Deep Dive

### Required Functions

Every ERC-20 token must implement these exact functions:

#### Core Information Functions

```solidity
// Returns the name of the token (e.g., "Ethereum")
function name() public view returns (string memory);

// Returns the symbol of the token (e.g., "ETH")
function symbol() public view returns (string memory);

// Returns the number of decimals the token uses (usually 18)
function decimals() public view returns (uint8);

// Returns the total token supply in circulation
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256);
```

#### Balance and Transfer Functions

```solidity
// Returns the token balance of a specific address
function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256);

// Transfers tokens from the caller to another address
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool);

// Returns how much the spender is allowed to spend on behalf of owner
function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view returns (uint256);

// Allows spender to withdraw from your account, multiple times, up to amount
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool);

// Transfers tokens from one address to another (requires prior approval)
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool);
```

### Required Events

ERC-20 tokens must emit these events for external applications to track activity:

```solidity
// Emitted when tokens are transferred
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

// Emitted when an approval is made
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
```

### Understanding Token Decimals

**Real-world analogy:** Just like US dollars have cents (2 decimal places), tokens have decimals. Most tokens use 18 decimals, meaning 1 token = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 base units.

**Why 18 decimals?**
- **Ethereum standard:** Ether uses 18 decimals (1 ETH = 1e18 wei)
- **Precision:** Allows for very small fractions without floating point issues
- **Compatibility:** Most DeFi protocols expect 18 decimals

**Example calculation:**
```
User wants to send 1.5 tokens
With 18 decimals: 1.5 * 10^18 = 1,500,000,000,000,000,000 base units
```

## Real-World ERC-20 Examples

### Stablecoins

**USDC (USD Coin):**
- **Purpose:** 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin
- **Decimals:** 6 (not 18!)
- **Features:** Pausable, blacklistable, upgradeable
- **Use case:** DeFi trading pairs, payments

**DAI (MakerDAO):**
- **Purpose:** Decentralized stablecoin backed by crypto collateral
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Features:** Governance token integration, stability mechanisms
- **Use case:** Decentralized lending, savings

### Utility Tokens

**UNI (Uniswap):**
- **Purpose:** Governance token for Uniswap DEX
- **Features:** Voting rights, fee distribution
- **Use case:** Protocol governance, incentive rewards

**LINK (Chainlink):**
- **Purpose:** Payment for oracle services
- **Features:** Standard ERC-20 with oracle integration
- **Use case:** Paying for off-chain data feeds

## Setting Up Your Token Development Project

### Prerequisites Check

Before we start, ensure you have completed the previous module and have:
- ✅ **Development environment set up** (VS Code, Node.js, Hardhat 3)
- ✅ **WSL2 configured** (Windows users)
- ✅ **MetaMask configured** with Zilliqa networks
- ✅ **Testnet ZIL** in your wallet
- ✅ **Working Hardhat project** from the previous module

### Project Structure for Token Development

We'll build our professional token project with this structure:

```

│   ├── MyToken.sol          # Main token contract
│   ├── MyToken.t.sol        # Solidity tests

### OpenZeppelin: Your Security Foundation

**Why use OpenZeppelin?**
- **Battle-tested:** Used by thousands of projects with billions in value
- **Secure by default:** Written by security experts and audited extensively
- **Modular design:** Pick only the features you need
- **Regular updates:** Maintained and improved continuously
- **Community support:** Extensive documentation and community

**Key OpenZeppelin contracts we'll use:**
- **ERC20.sol:** Base ERC-20 implementation
- **Ownable.sol:** Access control for administrative functions
- **Pausable.sol:** Emergency pause functionality
- **ERC20Burnable.sol:** Token burning capabilities
- **ERC20Capped.sol:** Maximum supply limits
- **AccessControl.sol:** Role-based permissions

### Planning Your Token Features

Before writing code, consider these questions:

#### Basic Properties
- **Name and Symbol:** What will your token be called?
- **Total Supply:** How many tokens will exist?
- **Decimals:** Will you use 18 decimals (recommended)?
- **Initial Distribution:** Who gets tokens when deployed?

#### Advanced Features
- **Minting:** Can new tokens be created after deployment?
- **Burning:** Can tokens be permanently destroyed?
- **Pausable:** Should you be able to pause all transfers?
- **Access Control:** Who can perform administrative actions?
- **Supply Cap:** Is there a maximum number of tokens?

#### Security Considerations
- **Ownership:** Will there be an owner with special privileges?
- **Upgradability:** Will the contract be upgradeable?
- **Time locks:** Should critical functions have delays?
- **Multi-sig:** Should important functions require multiple signatures?

## Token Development Best Practices

### Security First

**Always prioritize security:**
- ✅ **Use OpenZeppelin:** Don't reinvent security-critical code
- ✅ **Test thoroughly:** Both unit and integration tests
- ✅ **Audit before mainnet:** Get professional security audits
- ✅ **Start simple:** Add complexity gradually and carefully
- ✅ **Follow standards:** Stick to established patterns

### Gas Optimization

**Design for efficiency:**
- ✅ **Pack structs:** Minimize storage slots used
- ✅ **Use events:** Cheaper than storing data on-chain
- ✅ **Batch operations:** Combine multiple actions when possible
- ✅ **Choose appropriate data types:** Use uint256 for gas efficiency

### User Experience

**Make your token user-friendly:**
- ✅ **Clear naming:** Descriptive name and symbol
- ✅ **Standard decimals:** Use 18 unless you have a good reason not to
- ✅ **Good documentation:** Clear explanation of features
- ✅ **Predictable behavior:** Follow ERC-20 standard exactly

### Legal and Compliance

**Consider regulatory requirements:**
- ⚖️ **Securities laws:** Understand if your token might be a security
- ⚖️ **KYC/AML:** Consider if you need identity verification
- ⚖️ **Tax implications:** Understand tax treatment in your jurisdiction
- ⚖️ **Legal advice:** Consult lawyers for complex tokenomics

## What We'll Build
