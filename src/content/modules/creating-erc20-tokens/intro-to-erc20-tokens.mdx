## What Is an ERC-20 Token?

ERC-20 is the widely accepted standard defining fungible tokens. Fungibility means every token unit is identical and interchangeable, just like fiat currencies. This standard defines a common interface for tokens, allowing wallets, exchanges, and dApps to support any ERC-20 compliant token seamlessly.

### Core ERC-20 Functions and Their Purpose

- **totalSupply():** Returns total number of tokens in circulation
- **balanceOf(address):** Gets the token balance of a specified address
- **transfer(address, uint):** Moves tokens from the sender's address to another
- **approve(address, uint):** Authorizes another address to spend tokens on the owner's behalf
- **transferFrom(address, address, uint):** Executes transfer of tokens on behalf of another address

Popular stablecoins and tokens like USDT, USDC, and DAI conform to the ERC-20 standard.
