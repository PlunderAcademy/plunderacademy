## Verification and Tracking

Use the Zilliqa EVM block explorer to input your contract address and view your token, contract code, and transaction history.

### Checking Balances

Within Remix's deployed contracts panel, call balanceOf with your wallet address. This should return your full token balance considering decimals (usually 18).

### Token Transfers

Invoke transfer in Remix, entering the recipient's address and the amount to transfer (adjusted by decimals). Verify the recipient's updated balance on Remix or their MetaMask wallet.

### Adding Token to MetaMask

Add the deployed token contract address and symbol as a custom token in MetaMask. This enables seeing token balances directly in your wallet and enables transfers or dApp interactions.
