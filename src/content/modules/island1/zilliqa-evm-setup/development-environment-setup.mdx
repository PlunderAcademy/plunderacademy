## ⚠️ Important: Required Setup for All Future Modules

**This setup is required for all subsequent modules in this course.** Taking the time to properly configure your development environment now will save you hours of troubleshooting later. All future smart contract development, token creation, and deployment modules assume you have completed this setup successfully.

## Creating Your Professional Development Environment

### Overview: What We're Building

**Real-world analogy:** Setting up a development environment is like organizing a professional workshop. You need the right tools (VS Code), the power source (Node.js), and the specialized equipment (Hardhat) all working together seamlessly.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a complete development setup that enables you to:
- **Write smart contracts** with syntax highlighting and error detection
- **Compile and test** contracts locally before deployment
- **Deploy to Zilliqa** networks with confidence
- **Debug issues** efficiently with professional tools
- **Manage projects** with version control and package management

**What we'll install:**
1. **WSL2 (Windows only)** - Linux environment for optimal development
2. **VS Code** - Your primary development interface
3. **Node.js 22.10+** - The runtime environment for development tools
4. **Hardhat 3** - The professional framework for smart contract development
5. **Hardhat VS Code Extension** - Advanced Solidity support

## Windows Users: WSL2 Setup (REQUIRED)

### Why WSL2 for Blockchain Development?

**⚠️ CRITICAL FOR WINDOWS USERS:** WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is **REQUIRED** for this course, not optional. According to the [official Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/docs/getting-started#installation), WSL2 on Windows is essential for proper blockchain development. Without WSL2, you will encounter compatibility issues and errors in future modules.

**Benefits of WSL2:**
- **Better compatibility** with Node.js and npm packages
- **Faster file system operations** for compilation and testing
- **Linux-native tooling** that most blockchain tools are designed for
- **Better performance** for complex development workflows
- **Consistent environment** matching production deployments

**macOS and Linux users can skip this section** as they already have native Unix environments.

### Installing WSL2

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator** (Right-click Start button → Windows PowerShell (Admin))
2. **Enable WSL feature:**
   ```powershell
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
   ```
3. **Enable Virtual Machine Platform:**
   ```powershell
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
   ```
4. **Install WSL2**
   ```powershell
   wsl.exe --install
   ```

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL: RESTART YOUR COMPUTER NOW

**⚠️ You MUST restart your computer at this point for WSL2 to install properly.**

**If you see any message like "changes will not be effective until next reboot" or similar, RESTART IMMEDIATELY before proceeding.**

After restarting, continue with the next steps:

---

6. **Open PowerShell as Administrator again** (Right-click Start button → Windows PowerShell (Admin))
7. **Install Ubuntu**
   ```powershell
   wsl.exe --install Ubuntu
   ```
8. **Create user account** when prompted (this will be your Linux user - choose a simple username and password you'll remember)
9. **Navigate to your home directory:**
   ```bash
   cd $HOME
   ```
10. **Update the system:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

### Understanding WSL Command Prompts

**What you'll see after WSL is installed:**

When you successfully enter WSL, your command prompt will change to show a **`$`** symbol (bash prompt), which looks like this:
```bash
username@computername:~$
```

**Important notes about using WSL:**
- Every time you open a new terminal or command prompt window, you'll start in Windows PowerShell
- To enter WSL, simply type `wsl` and press Enter
- You'll know you're in WSL when you see the `$` bash prompt
- All commands in this course that show `bash` code blocks should be run in the WSL bash prompt (after typing `wsl`)

**Example of entering WSL:**
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell prompt looks like:
PS C:\Users\YourName>

# Type wsl and press Enter:
PS C:\Users\YourName> wsl

# Now you're in WSL bash (notice the $ prompt):
username@computername:~$
```

### Troubleshooting: "Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions"

**If you run `wsl` and see this error message:**

```
Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions.
Distributions can be installed by visiting the Microsoft Store:
https://aka.ms/wslstore
```

**Solution:**
1. **Restart your computer again** (WSL installation may not have completed)
2. **After restart, open PowerShell as Administrator**
3. **Run step 7 again:**
   ```powershell
   wsl.exe --install Ubuntu
   ```
4. **Wait for Ubuntu to fully install and create your user account**

### Installation Process

#### Download VS Code

1. **Visit the official download page:** https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
2. **Select Windows** - the page should automatically detect your system
3. **Choose "User Installer"** (recommended for single-user Windows installations)
4. **Click the download button** for the appropriate architecture:
   - **x64** for most modern Windows computers
   - **Arm64** only if you have an ARM-based Windows device

#### Install VS Code

1. **Run the downloaded installer** (`VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe`)
2. **Accept the license agreement**
3. **Choose installation location** (default is usually fine)
4. **Select additional tasks** - recommended selections:
   - ✅ **Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer file context menu**
   - ✅ **Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer directory context menu**
   - ✅ **Register Code as an editor for supported file types**
   - ✅ **Add to PATH** (this enables `code` command in terminal)
5. **Click Install** and wait for completion
6. **Launch VS Code** when installation finishes

#### Verify Installation

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Check version:** Help → About (should be version 1.85 or newer)
3. **Test terminal:** View → Terminal (should open integrated terminal)
4. **Test command palette:** Ctrl+Shift+P (should open command search)

#### Configure VS Code for WSL2

1. **Install "WSL" extension** in VS Code by Microsoft
2. **Connect to WSL:** Click the remote connection button (bottom-left corner) → "New WSL Window"
3. **Verify connection:** Terminal should show Linux prompt, not Windows

### Using the Terminal in VS Code

**VS Code has a built-in terminal that's perfect for running commands:**

1. **Open the terminal:** View → Terminal (or press Ctrl+`)
2. **If you see PowerShell prompt** (PS C:\...), type `wsl` and press Enter
3. **You should now see the bash $ prompt** where you can run all Linux commands

**Quick tip:** Once you open a WSL window in VS Code (using the remote connection button), the integrated terminal will automatically open in WSL bash - no need to type `wsl` each time!

**All subsequent steps in this guide should be performed in WSL2 Ubuntu terminal** if you're on Windows. You can use either:
- The VS Code integrated terminal (View → Terminal, then type `wsl` if needed)
- A standalone terminal where you type `wsl` to enter bash

### 💾 Critical VS Code Tip: Always Save Your Files!

**This is the #1 mistake beginners make in VS Code - not saving files before compiling or running commands.**

**How to know if a file needs saving:**
- Look at the file tab at the top - if you see a **white dot** next to the filename, the file is **NOT saved**
- An **X** (close button) means the file is saved and up to date

**Ways to save files:**
- **Single file:** Press **Ctrl+S** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+S** (Mac)
- **All open files:** Press **Ctrl+K** then **S**, or use **File → Save All** from the menu
- **Enable auto-save:** File → Preferences → Settings → search for "Auto Save" → select "afterDelay"

**Why this matters for smart contract development:**
- ❌ Edit a contract without saving → compile command runs on old code → you'll be confused why your changes aren't working
- ❌ Edit `.env` file without saving → deployment fails with wrong credentials
- ❌ Edit config files without saving → settings don't take effect
- ❌ Edit scripts without saving → old version runs

**Pro tip:** Get in the habit of using **File → Save All** (Ctrl+K then S) before running any terminal command. This simple habit will save you hours of debugging!

- ✅ **Use different wallets** for development and production
- ✅ **Keep testnet and mainnet keys separate**
- ✅ **Regular backups** of your `.env` file in a secure location
- ✅ **Use hardware wallets** for mainnet deployments with real funds

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Node.js Issues

**"node is not recognized" or "command not found":**
- Restart your terminal after Node.js installation
- Run `source ~/.bashrc` to reload your bash profile
- Verify NVM is installed: `nvm --version`
- Try installing Node again: `nvm install 22`

**"npm: command not found":**
- npm comes with Node.js, so reinstall Node: `nvm install 22`
- Verify with `which npm` to see if it's in your PATH

### WSL-Specific Issues (Windows Users)

**"wsl: command not found":**
- Ensure WSL2 is fully installed (see installation section)
- Restart your computer after WSL2 installation
- Open PowerShell as Administrator and run: `wsl --status`

**"Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions":**
- Restart your computer
- Open PowerShell as Administrator
- Run: `wsl.exe --install Ubuntu`
- Wait for Ubuntu to fully install

**"Cannot find module" or path errors:**
- Make sure you're running commands inside WSL (you should see the `$` prompt)
- Type `wsl` in your terminal to enter WSL
- Stay in the WSL file system (~/), not Windows drives (`/mnt/c/...`)

**VS Code not connecting to WSL:**
- Install the "WSL" extension by Microsoft
- Click the remote connection button (bottom-left corner)
- Select "New WSL Window"
- Restart VS Code if needed

### VS Code Issues

**Extensions not working:**
