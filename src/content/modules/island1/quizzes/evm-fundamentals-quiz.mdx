---

### Question 2
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 2.1 & 2.2 Ethereum Virtual Machine and Execution

Why is deterministic execution critical in EVM operations?

**Options:**
- A) So contracts produce different results on different nodes
- B) So all nodes compute the same contract output ensuring consensus
- C) To speed up contract compilation
- D) To reduce storage requirements on the blockchain

---

### Question 3

---

### Question 4
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 2.1 & 2.2 Ethereum Virtual Machine and Execution

What holds the contract state persistently between transactions in EVM?

**Options:**
- A) Memory that gets cleared after execution
- B) Storage that persists permanently on the blockchain
- C) Calldata that contains function parameters
- D) Stack that holds temporary computation values

---

### Question 5
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 2.1 & 2.2 Ethereum Virtual Machine and Execution

What role does ABI (Application Binary Interface) serve in contract interaction?

**Options:**
- A) Defines how external applications interact with contract functions and their parameters
- B) Encrypts smart contract code for security
- C) Acts as a gas meter for transaction costs
- D) Stores the contract's source code on the blockchain

---

### Question 6
**Type:** Concept Matching
**Points:** 8
**Lesson:** 2.3 Gas Mechanism

Match each EVM concept with its definition:

**Interactive Data:**
```json
{
  "concepts": [
    {"id": "gas", "text": "Gas", "category": "execution"},
    {"id": "wei", "text": "Wei", "category": "currency"},
    {"id": "opcode", "text": "Opcode", "category": "execution"},
    {"id": "storage", "text": "Storage", "category": "memory"}
  ],
  "definitions": [
    {"id": "def-gas", "text": "Unit that measures computational work on EVM"},
    {"id": "def-wei", "text": "Smallest denomination of ether (10^-18 ETH)"},
    {"id": "def-opcode", "text": "Basic instruction in EVM bytecode"},
    {"id": "def-storage", "text": "Permanent key-value data store for contracts"}
  ]
}
```

### Question 7
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 2.3 Gas Mechanism

What happens if a transaction exceeds its gas limit?

**Options:**
- A) The transaction proceeds without limits
- B) The transaction is reverted and no state changes occur, but gas is still consumed
- C) The transaction is paused and resumed later
- D) The transaction completes but costs extra fees

---
