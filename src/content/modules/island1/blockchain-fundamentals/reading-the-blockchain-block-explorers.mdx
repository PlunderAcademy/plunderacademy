## Understanding Block Explorers

### What Is a Block Explorer?

**Real-world analogy:** Think of a block explorer like a combination of Google Maps and a public records office for the blockchain. Just as you can look up any address, see who lives there, and track the history of a property, block explorers let you look up any blockchain address, see what transactions happened, and track the complete history of any account or smart contract.

**Technical definition:** A block explorer is a web-based tool that allows you to search, view, and analyze all data stored on a blockchain network in a user-friendly format.

### Why Block Explorers Are Essential

**Transparency in action:** Blockchain promises transparency, but raw blockchain data is unreadable to humans. Block explorers translate this data into understandable information.

**Key use cases:**
- **Transaction verification:** Confirm your payments went through
- **Address investigation:** Research wallets or contracts before interacting
- **Gas analysis:** Understand why transactions cost what they do
- **Smart contract exploration:** See how contracts work and what they do
- **Network monitoring:** Track network health and activity
- **Debugging:** Figure out why transactions failed

## Troubleshooting Failed Transactions

### Common Failure Reasons

#### Out of Gas
**What happened:** Transaction ran out of gas before completion
**Blockscout shows:** Status "Failed", gas used equals gas limit
**Solution:** Increase gas limit for future transactions

**Example:**
```
Status: Failed ❌
Gas Used: 100,000 / 100,000 (100% - this is the problem!)
Error: "Out of gas"
```

#### Insufficient Balance
**What happened:** Not enough tokens or ZIL to complete transaction
**Blockscout shows:** Status "Failed", error message about insufficient funds
**Solution:** Ensure adequate balance before retrying

#### Smart Contract Revert
**What happened:** Contract code rejected the transaction (e.g., conditions not met)
**Blockscout shows:** Status "Failed", specific revert reason in error message
**Solution:** Address the specific condition that caused the revert

**Example revert reasons:**
- "Transfer amount exceeds balance"
- "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance"
- "Ownable: caller is not the owner"

### Gas Analysis for Optimization

#### Gas Usage Patterns
**Analyzing successful transactions:**
- **Gas estimate accuracy:** How well you estimated gas needs
- **Optimization opportunities:** Compare similar transactions for efficiency
- **Cost trends:** Track gas prices over time for better timing

#### Fee Optimization
**Finding the right balance:**
- **Speed vs. cost:** Higher gas prices for faster confirmation
- **Network conditions:** Adjust gas price based on network congestion
- **Transaction complexity:** More complex operations need more gas
