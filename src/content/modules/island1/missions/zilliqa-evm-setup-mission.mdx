Mission 4: The Stepped Pyramid

Beyond the volcanic fortress, you find a massive stepped pyramid rising from the jungle. Sunlight glints off its stone terraces, each step a symbol of new skills gained and challenges overcome. Here, progress is measured not just by what you know, but by how you put that knowledge to work—every level taking you closer to true mastery.
