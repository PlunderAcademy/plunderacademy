Mission 5: The Ancient Stone Circle

Your quest ends at an ancient stone circle, hidden in the jungle and illuminated by the glow of the Gobekli Sun Disk. Carved pillars surround the center, each inscribed with forgotten symbols—reminders of builders who came before. It's here that everything you've learned comes together: you're tasked to create, launch, and interact with your very own token on the blockchain.

This is the moment where knowledge becomes creation. Designing your token means shaping its purpose, writing its contract, deploying it on Zilliqa EVM, and then seeing it exist and move on-chain. The sun disk at the heart of the circle represents your new power as a builder—radiant, sharable, and enduring.
