Mission 1: The Marooned Ship

You awaken on the shore, the roar of crashing waves filling the air, heavy with the tang of salt and mystery. The wreckage around you sparks questions that refuse to fade—could anyone have survived the storm? Is there a way off this island? What ancient secrets lie hidden beyond the tangled jungle? Yet amidst these swirling doubts, one craving lingers stronger than the rest—a thirst for the last precious treasure that every true pirate knows must be found before anything else.

That elusive prize, whispered about in stories and hinted at in shadows, calls to you like a beacon through the chaos. But before you can claim it, you must uncover the deeper mysteries embedded in this ruined ship—secrets not of gold or jewels, but of a powerful new world: the blockchain.

Each broken plank and scattered barrel reveals fragments of knowledge about networks, consensus, and living ecosystems. This knowledge is your compass. Master it, and the coveted treasure will be yours, fueling your spirit for the perilous journey ahead.
