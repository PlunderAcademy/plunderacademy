## Deployment with Hardhat 3

### Why Manual Deployment Scripts?

**Hardhat Ignition vs Manual Scripts:**

While Hardhat Ignition provides declarative deployments, **Zilliqa networks are not yet fully supported** by Ignition. Manual deployment scripts offer:

- **Full control** over deployment process
- **Better debugging** capabilities 
- **Network compatibility** with all EVM chains including Zilliqa
- **Custom logic** during deployment (transfers, setup calls, etc.)
- **Detailed logging** for verification and troubleshooting

### Setting Up Package.json Scripts

**First, let's add convenient npm scripts to your `package.json`:**

```json
{
  "name": "my-first-token",
  "version": "0.12.18",
  "description": "",

### Setting Up Testnet Deployment

Before deploying to Zilliqa testnet, you need a dedicated development wallet with testnet ZIL.

#### Understanding Wallet Setup

**You'll be working with two wallet addresses:**

**Development Wallet** (newly generated): Used for deploying contracts and paying gas fees
   - Gets a fresh private key for security
   - Funded with testnet ZIL from the faucet
   - Used for deployment transactions only

**Training Portal Wallet** (your existing wallet): Used for achievement verification
   - The wallet you use to connect to Plunder Academy
   - Set as the `claimant` in your token contract
   - Used to verify you completed the training module

#### Create a Fresh Development Wallet

**Step 1: Generate a new private key for development** (never use your main wallet)

Run this command in your WSL bash terminal:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

**Expected output:** A 64-character hexadecimal string like:
```
a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456
```

**Copy this entire string** - you'll need it in the next step.

**Step 2: Edit your .env file**

If you already have a `.env` file from the previous module, open it in VS Code. If not, create a new file:

1. In VS Code, look at the left sidebar showing your project files
2. Right-click in the empty space below the last file
3. Select "New File"
4. Name it `.env` (include the dot at the beginning)

**Add or update these lines in your .env file:**

```
ZILLIQA_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x_PASTE_YOUR_GENERATED_KEY_HERE

ZILLIQA_MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x_your_production_key_here_when_ready

CLAIMANT_ADDRESS=0x_YOUR_TRAINING_PORTAL_WALLET_ADDRESS

# IMPORTANT: Never commit this file to version control
# Add .env to your .gitignore file
# This wallet is for development/testing only
# CLAIMANT_ADDRESS should be your main wallet connected to the training portal
```

**Step 3: Fill in your actual values**

1. **ZILLIQA_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY:** Replace `_PASTE_YOUR_GENERATED_KEY_HERE` with the 64-character string from Step 1
   - **Important:** Keep the `0x` prefix, then paste your key after it
   - This is 66 characters total (0x + 64 hex characters)
   - Example: `ZILLIQA_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY=0xa1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456`

2. **CLAIMANT_ADDRESS:** Replace `_YOUR_TRAINING_PORTAL_WALLET_ADDRESS` with your actual wallet address

---

### 🚨 CRITICAL: CLAIMANT_ADDRESS is your PUBLIC ADDRESS, NOT your private key!

**⚠️ STOP! Read this carefully to avoid a serious security mistake:**

**CLAIMANT_ADDRESS is your PUBLIC wallet address:**
- ✅ **This is your PUBLIC address** - safe to share, visible to everyone
- ✅ **40 hex characters** (42 with `0x` prefix)
- ✅ **Shorter than a private key** - only 42 characters total
- ✅ **Example:** `0x47830f1be175a7f8b2906eff6e252b5d4fa3cc91` (42 characters)

**How to get your PUBLIC address from MetaMask:**
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click on your account name at the top
3. Your address will be copied - this is what you need
4. It should be 42 characters starting with `0x`

**What CLAIMANT_ADDRESS is NOT:**
- ❌ **NOT your private key** (private keys are 66 characters: `0x` + 64 hex)
- ❌ **NOT your seed phrase** (12-24 words)
- ❌ **NOT secret** - this is your public identifier

**If you accidentally pasted your private key here:**
1. ❌ **STOP immediately** - do not deploy
2. 🔴 **That wallet is compromised** - assume someone else can access it
3. 🆕 **Create a new wallet** with a new private key
4. 💸 **Transfer any funds** from the old wallet to your new one
5. 🔄 **Start over** with the new wallet

**Visual difference:**
```
✅ PUBLIC ADDRESS (use for CLAIMANT_ADDRESS):
0x47830f1be175a7f8b2906eff6e252b5d4fa3cc91
   ↑ 42 characters total

❌ PRIVATE KEY (NEVER put in CLAIMANT_ADDRESS):
0xa1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456
   ↑ 66 characters total - much longer!
```

---

💾 **CRITICAL: SAVE THE .env FILE NOW!** 
- Press **Ctrl+S** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+S** (Mac)
- **The deployment will fail if the .env file is not saved with your keys!**
- Check that the white dot next to `.env` disappears in VS Code

**Your .env file should now look like this (with your actual values):**

```
# Private key for testnet deployments (66 characters with 0x)
ZILLIQA_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY=0xa1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456

# Private key for mainnet (when ready)
ZILLIQA_MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x_your_production_key_here_when_ready

# PUBLIC wallet address for achievement claims (42 characters with 0x)
# THIS IS YOUR PUBLIC ADDRESS - NOT A PRIVATE KEY!
CLAIMANT_ADDRESS=0x47830f1be175a7f8b2906eff6e252b5d4fa3cc91

# IMPORTANT: Never commit this file to version control
# Add .env to your .gitignore file
# This wallet is for development/testing only
```

**Double-check your .env file:**
- ✅ `ZILLIQA_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY` should be **66 characters** (0x + 64 hex)
- ✅ `CLAIMANT_ADDRESS` should be **42 characters** (0x + 40 hex)
- ❌ If both are the same length, you made a mistake!
- ❌ If `CLAIMANT_ADDRESS` is 66 characters, you put a private key there - **STOP and fix this!**

**Step 4: Import the development wallet into MetaMask**

Now import your newly generated private key into MetaMask so you can use it for deployments:

1. Open MetaMask and click the account icon (top right)
2. Select **"Import Account"** from the menu
3. Select **"Private Key"** as the import type
4. Paste your complete private key **including the 0x prefix**
   - Example: `0xa1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456`
5. Click **"Import"**
6. **Label this account** something like "Dev - Testnet" so you remember it's for testing only

⚠️ **Security reminder:** This is a development-only wallet - never use it for real funds or mainnet deployments with significant value

**Step 5: Add Zilliqa testnet to MetaMask** (if not already configured)

If you haven't added Zilliqa testnet yet, add it now:

1. Open MetaMask and click the network dropdown (top left)
2. Click **"Add Network"** or **"Add a network manually"**
3. Fill in the network details:
   - **Network Name:** `Zilliqa Testnet`
   - **RPC URL:** `https://api.testnet.zilliqa.com`
   - **Chain ID:** `33101`
   - **Currency Symbol:** `ZIL`
   - **Block Explorer:** `https://testnet.zilliqa.blockscout.com`
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Switch to the Zilliqa Testnet network

**Step 6: Fund your development wallet with testnet ZIL**

Your new wallet needs testnet ZIL to pay for gas fees when deploying:

1. Make sure you're switched to your newly imported development wallet in MetaMask
2. **Copy your wallet address** (click the account name to copy)
3. Visit the **[Zilliqa Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.zilliqa.com)**
4. **Paste your development wallet address**
5. Click to request testnet ZIL
6. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for the transaction to confirm
7. You should receive **100 ZIL** for testing

✅ **You're now ready to deploy!** Your development wallet is funded and configured.

### Deploy to Zilliqa Testnet

💾 **FINAL CHECK: Are ALL your files saved?**
- Use **File → Save All** (or Ctrl+K then S) to save everything
- Check for white dots on file tabs in VS Code - if you see any, those files are NOT saved!
- Common forgotten files: `.env`, `hardhat.config.ts`, contract files, deployment scripts

**Before deploying, verify your setup:**
- ✅ Your `.env` file has `ZILLIQA_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY` with your generated private key
- ✅ Your `.env` file has `CLAIMANT_ADDRESS` with your training portal wallet address
- ✅ Your development wallet is imported into MetaMask
- ✅ Your development wallet has testnet ZIL (check balance in MetaMask)
- ✅ MetaMask is connected to Zilliqa Testnet
- ✅ **ALL FILES ARE SAVED** (no white dots in VS Code tabs!)

**Deploy your contract to testnet** (run this command in your WSL bash terminal):
```bash
npm run deploy:zilliqaTestnet
```

**Expected testnet deployment output:**
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

**Verify your deployment:**

**Check contract on Zilliqa Blockscout:** 
   - Visit https://testnet.zilliqa.blockscout.com
   - Search for your contract address
   - Verify the deployment transaction succeeded
   - Check the contract creation and token transfer transactions

## Creating Interaction Scripts

### Contract Interaction Script

**Create `scripts/interact.ts`:**

```typescript
import { network } from "hardhat";
import { formatEther } from "viem";

async function main() {
  // Get contract address from environment variable or use default
  const contractAddress = process.env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
  const networkName = process.env.HARDHAT_NETWORK || "localhost";
  
  if (!contractAddress) {
    console.error("❌ Please provide CONTRACT_ADDRESS environment variable");
    console.log("Usage: CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... npm run interact");
    process.exit(1);
  }

  console.log(`Interacting with MyFirstToken on ${networkName}...`);
  console.log("Contract address:", contractAddress);
  
  try {

```

### Production Deployment Considerations

**Before mainnet deployment:**

✅ **Code Review:** Have the contract reviewed by multiple developers \
✅ **Security Audit:** Consider professional security audit for significant projects \
✅ **Comprehensive Testing:** All tests pass with high coverage \
✅ **Gas Optimization:** Analyze and optimize gas usage \
✅ **Documentation:** Complete documentation and comments \
✅ **Multi-sig Setup:** Consider multi-signature wallets for admin functions

### Mainnet Deployment Process

**When ready for production:**

1. **Create a dedicated mainnet private key** (hardware wallet recommended)
2. **Add mainnet configuration** to hardhat.config.ts
3. **Fund the deployment wallet** with sufficient ZIL for deployment
4. **Deploy using the script:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:zilliqaMainnet  # You'll need to add this script
   ```

### Post-Deployment Tasks

**After successful deployment:**

1. **Contract Verification:** Submit source code to block explorer
2. **Security Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for unusual activity  
3. **Documentation:** Update all documentation with contract addresses
4. **Community Announcement:** Announce deployment to your community
5. **Exchange Listings:** Begin process for exchange listings if applicable
