## Introduction

Remix IDE is a powerful browser-based Solidity editor providing an accessible environment to write, compile, deploy, and test contracts quickly without special local setup.

### Development Steps

1. **Open Remix IDE**
   
   Visit the Remix IDE web app through your browser.

2. **Write Your Contract**
   
   Create a new Solidity file, for example HelloZil.sol:
   
   ```solidity
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
   
   contract HelloZil {
       string public message = "Hello, Zilliqa!";
       
       function setMessage(string calldata newMessage) public {
           message = newMessage;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Compile the Contract**
   
   Select the appropriate Solidity compiler version (at least 0.8.0) and compile the contract.

4. **Deploy Using MetaMask**
   
   In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, set environment to "Injected Provider - MetaMask". Confirm your MetaMask network is set to Zilliqa EVM. Click "Deploy" and approve the transaction in MetaMask.

5. **Interact with Your Contract**
   
   Once deployed, use Remix to call contract functions such as reading or updating the message variable.
