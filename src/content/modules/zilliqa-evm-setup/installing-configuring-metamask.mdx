## Introduction

MetaMask is the most widely used Ethereum-compatible browser wallet, allowing users to manage accounts, sign transactions, and connect with decentralized applications. With Zilliqa's EVM support, you can use MetaMask similarly to how you use it on Ethereum.

### Step-by-Step MetaMask Setup Guide

1. **Install MetaMask**
   
   Download the MetaMask browser extension and add it to your preferred browser. Follow the prompts to create a new wallet or import an existing one. Carefully record and securely store your seed phrase.

2. **Add the Zilliqa EVM Network to MetaMask**
   
   Open MetaMask and click the network dropdown menu. Select "Add Network" and fill in the following:
   
   - Network Name: Zilliqa EVM Mainnet
   - RPC URL: https://api.zilliqa.com
   - Chain ID: 32769
   - Currency Symbol: ZIL
   - Block Explorer URL: [To be configured]

3. **Save and Connect**
   
   After entering these details, save the network. Switch your MetaMask wallet network to Zilliqa EVM before proceeding.

4. **Verify Connection**
   
   Confirm that your MetaMask wallet shows the current ZIL balance and can send test transactions on the Zilliqa EVM network.

### Security Recommendations

- Store your seed phrase safely offline and never share it
- Avoid entering seed phrases on websites or pasting them into digital files
- Consider enhancing security by using a hardware wallet for key management
