## Introduction

To develop on Zilliqa EVM testnet without spending real cryptocurrency, you need to acquire test ZIL tokens. These tokens facilitate testing contract deployments and interactions without financial risk.

### Steps

1. **Locate an Official Faucet**
   
   Find a Zilliqa testnet faucet through official documentation or developer portals.

2. **Request Tokens**
   
   Input your Zilliqa EVM-compatible wallet address from MetaMask into the faucet form. After submission, test tokens are usually distributed within minutes.

3. **Verify Balance in MetaMask**
   
   Your MetaMask wallet should reflect the new test ZIL balance.

4. **Use the Zilliqa Block Explorer**
   
   Navigate to the block explorer platform and enter your wallet or contract address to view transactions, contract creations, balance updates, and block confirmations.
