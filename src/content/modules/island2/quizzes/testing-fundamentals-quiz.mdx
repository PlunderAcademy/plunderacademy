### Question 1
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.1 Framework Setup

Which is a best practice for structuring Solidity tests?

**Options:**
- A) Write a single test that covers all contract behavior
- B) Group tests by feature/behavior with descriptive names and isolated setup
- C) Avoid setup/teardown to reduce boilerplate
- D) Use `console.log` as the primary assertion mechanism
---

### Question 2
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.2 Unit Testing Patterns

What is the key benefit of using fixtures in test suites?

**Options:**
- A) Automatically deploys to mainnet
- B) Reuses prepared state across tests for speed and consistency
- C) Eliminates the need for assertions
- D) Ensures tests only run once
---

### Question 3
**Type:** Multiple Select
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.2 Unit Testing Patterns

Which are recommended unit testing patterns?

**Options:**
- A) Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- B) Name tests by ticket number only
- C) One assertion maximum per test
- D) Use helpers/builders to reduce repetition
---

### Question 4
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.3 Security Testing

What is the purpose of fuzzing in Ethereum smart contract tests?

**Options:**
- A) Randomly mutate bytecode to reduce size
- B) Explore edge cases by generating many random inputs
- C) Replace unit tests with end-to-end tests
- D) Automatically deploy to multiple chains
---

### Question 5
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.1 Framework Setup

In Foundry, which cheatcode or helper is commonly used to manipulate block timestamps?

**Options:**
- A) `vm.prank()`
- B) `vm.warp()`
- C) `vm.roll()`
- D) `vm.snapshot()`
---

### Question 6
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.2 Unit Testing Patterns

What is a good approach to testing revert conditions?

**Options:**
- A) Skip negative tests to save time
- B) Use `expectRevert` or equivalent to assert specific errors
- C) Assume reverts will be caught in production
- D) Only test happy-path logic
---

### Question 7
**Type:** Timeline Builder
**Points:** 8
**Lesson:** 3.1 Framework Setup

Arrange a typical test lifecycle for a unit test.

**Interactive Data:**
```json
{
  "events": [
    {"id": "evt-1", "text": "Deploy contracts/fixtures"},
    {"id": "evt-2", "text": "Arrange inputs"},
    {"id": "evt-3", "text": "Act: call function"},
    {"id": "evt-4", "text": "Assert expectations"}
  ]
}
```

### Question 8
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.2 Unit Testing Patterns

Which helps keep tests deterministic?

**Options:**
- A) Rely on wall-clock time
- B) Control randomness/seed and block timestamp
- C) Use external oracle data
- D) Skip setup to reduce code
---

### Question 9
**Type:** Multiple Select
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.3 Security Testing

Which are examples of security-focused tests?

**Options:**
- A) Reentrancy attempt against sensitive function
- B) Overflow test with `unchecked` arithmetic
- C) Admin function access with non-admin
- D) UI rendering snapshot
---

### Question 10
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.2 Unit Testing Patterns

What is the advantage of using builders/factories in tests?

**Options:**
- A) They remove the need for test assertions entirely
- B) They generate reproducible objects with minimal boilerplate
- C) They automatically deploy on every chain
- D) They make tests slower but more readable
---

### Question 11
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.1 Framework Setup

Which command runs Foundry tests with fuzzing enabled by default?

**Options:**
- A) `forge test`
- B) `forge fuzz`
- C) `forge run`
- D) `forge verify`
---

### Question 12
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 7
**Lesson:** 3.3 Security Testing

Which practice improves coverage for time-based logic?

**Options:**
- A) Avoid testing time logic; rely on production
- B) Use `vm.warp()` to simulate time progression and test boundaries
- C) Run tests at midnight
- D) Only test exact equality for timestamps
---

### Question 13
**Type:** Word Jumble
**Points:** 8
**Lesson:** 3.2 Unit Testing Patterns

Unscramble this concept central to test structure:

**Interactive Data:**
```json
{
  "hint": "Three-part testing style: setup, execution, verification",
  "scrambled": "SNAGRAAEESRTR"
}
```

### Question 14
**Type:** Multiple Choice
**Points:** 8
**Lesson:** 3.3 Security Testing

What is a key sign of a flaky test?

**Options:**
- A) It passes only on CI
- B) It fails intermittently without code changes due to timing or randomness
- C) It has many assertions
- D) It uses descriptive names
