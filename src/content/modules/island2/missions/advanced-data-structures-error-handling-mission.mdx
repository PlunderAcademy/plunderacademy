"Verification is faith in a world built on lies."

The storm clears. A city appears, glowing igloos of refracted data. Inside, builders worship a single truth: nothing is real until it's tested.

Every corridor hums with frameworks. They use nested mappings to link stakers to their data. Every dome glows with verified logic. They organize storage with packed structs to reduce gas and employ safe array patterns to build iterable-friendly models.

Testing is their religion; failure, their prophecy. They are obsessively avoiding footguns.

You learn to write tests as dialogue between intent and outcome. The silver thread reveals itself, not magic, but verification.
