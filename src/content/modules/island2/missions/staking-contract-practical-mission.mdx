"All creation ends in reflection."

At the heart of the island stands the Mammoth — a relic of the old world, tusks of ice, eyes like mirrors. Bound in a prison of his own making — an eternal loop of frozen time.

He is the island’s first architect, the one who wove the silver thread through all things. His curse is the same as yours: perfection sought, never reached. The only way to free him is to complete what he began — to deploy a staking contract flawless in design, time-locked, tested, incorruptible.

As your code compiles, the silver thread ignites, running from your hands into the island itself. The ice shatters. The Mammoth exhales for the first time in centuries.

Freedom isn’t the absence of constraint — it’s the mastery of it.
