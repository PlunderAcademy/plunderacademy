"All creation ends in reflection."

At the island's heart stands the Mammoth: tusks of ice, eyes like mirrors. Bound in a loop of frozen time, he is the island's first architect, cursed to witness perfection sought, never reached.

He wove the silver thread through all things. His curse is yours: to complete his work and master the constraints of blockchain development.

To free the Mammoth from his curse, you must build the final artifact: a production-ready staking contract that demonstrates mastery over all prior lessons, featuring duration tiers and flawless reward calculations.

When your code compiles, the thread ignites. The Mammoth exhales. The ice shatters.

Freedom is not the absence of constraint. It is mastery of it. Completing this practical is the key to his release.
