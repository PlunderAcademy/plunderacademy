"The higher you climb, the heavier your logic becomes."

The peaks rise above you, carved by forgotten algorithms.  
The wind cuts deep, but beneath it there’s rhythm. The thread calls you upward.  

Here, inefficiency kills faster than the cold.  
Each wasted instruction is another heartbeat lost to entropy.  
You see patterns in the frost: gas optimizations, reentrancy guards, custom errors.  

This is more than survival. It’s discipline.  
Precision carved by necessity. Solidity as instinct.
