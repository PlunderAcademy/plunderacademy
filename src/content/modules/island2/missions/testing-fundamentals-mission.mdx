"Verification is faith in a world built on lies."

The storm breaks, revealing a sight that shouldn’t exist — Igloo City. Its walls refract light like a thousand prisms, each block alive with data. Inside, you find a civilization of builders obsessed with one truth: nothing is real until it’s tested.

Every corridor hums with energy from testing frameworks, every dome gleams with the glow of verified logic. Here, test-driven development is religion, and failure is treated as prophecy.

You learn to write tests not as checks, but as conversations between intent and outcome. For the first time, you understand the island’s silver thread isn’t magic. It’s verification — proof that reality itself can be debugged.
