  name: "Desert Architect"
  description: "Mastered advanced Solidity inheritance and interface patterns"

The scorching desert sun beats down as you approach an ancient oasis. Legend speaks of a master architect who built the most elegant contract systems in all the blockchain realms. But the knowledge is locked away, waiting for someone skilled enough to unlock the secrets of advanced Solidity patterns.

---

As you examine the oasis, you notice intricate patterns carved into the stone - they seem to represent contract inheritance hierarchies and interface designs. The patterns pulse with ethereal energy, suggesting they hold the key to understanding advanced smart contract architecture.

---

A shimmering mirage appears, revealing the ghost of the master architect. "Welcome, seeker of knowledge," the spirit intones. "To claim the title of Desert Architect, you must prove your mastery of the sacred patterns - inheritance, interfaces, and the art of composable contract design."

---

"First, you must understand that true power comes not from complex contracts, but from simple, well-designed building blocks that work together in harmony. Show me you can create an inheritance hierarchy that is both powerful and maintainable."

---

"Next, demonstrate your knowledge of interface design. Create clean contracts between different parts of your system. Remember, interfaces are the bridges that allow different contract worlds to communicate without knowing each other's secrets."

---

"Finally, prove you can avoid the ancient pitfalls - the Diamond Problem, the leaky abstractions, and the monolithic contracts that have trapped so many developers in the past. Show me elegant composition over complex inheritance."

---

The spirit gestures toward a series of stone tablets. "Complete the trial by implementing the Oasis Protocol - a modular system for managing resources, access control, and rewards. Use the advanced patterns you've learned to create something that even I would be proud to call architecture."

---

With determination burning in your heart like the desert sun, you begin to implement the patterns that will unlock the secrets of the oasis and earn you the title of Desert Architect.
