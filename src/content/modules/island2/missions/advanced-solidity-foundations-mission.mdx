"When the signal dies, all that remains is the echo of creation."

The descent wasn’t meant to happen.  
A routine voyage through the metaverse shattered by static.  
An electromagnetic pulse tore through both code and conscience.  

You awaken in the wreckage, half-buried in snow and silence.  
The island stretches before you, white and whispering.  

Fragments of contracts lie scattered like bones.  
Interfaces, libraries, inheritance structures; relics of a lost logic.  
Through the frost, a faint filament hums beneath the ice.  
You feel it: not energy, but logic itself. Solidity in its purest form.  

Every construct you rebuild is remembrance.  
Reclaiming the architectures of the ancients is how you survive.
