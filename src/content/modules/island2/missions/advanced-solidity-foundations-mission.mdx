"The higher you climb, the heavier your logic becomes."

The peaks loom above you — monolithic spires of ice, carved by forgotten algorithms. The wind bites, but beneath it there’s a pulse. The same silver frequency. The thread calls you upward.

Here, inefficiency kills faster than the cold. Every instruction you waste is another heartbeat lost to entropy. You begin to see patterns in the frost — gas optimization, reentrancy guards, custom errors engraved into the frozen walls like warnings left by those who failed.

This isn’t just about survival. It’s discipline — precision carved by necessity. Solidity is no longer syntax. It’s instinct.
