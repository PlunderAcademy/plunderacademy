"Patience is power. Delay shapes design."

Beyond the city lies chaos, a sea of drifting ice.  
Each floe moves to its own rhythm; each crack echoes eternity.  

Here you study staking: waiting to move, moving to wait.  
Time-locked contracts, delayed reward, trust between block and heartbeat.  

The thread pulses beneath the ice.  
Time and logic merge. Every calculation has weight.
