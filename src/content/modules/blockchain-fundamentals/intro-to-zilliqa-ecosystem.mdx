## The Zilliqa Developer Ecosystem Overview

Zilliqa 2.0 offers a high-performance, scalable blockchain platform fully compatible with Ethereum's EVM standards. Developers can use popular Ethereum development tools like MetaMask, Remix, Hardhat, and OpenZeppelin to build decentralized applications on Zilliqa with minimal adaptation.

### Essential Tooling to Get Started

- **MetaMask Wallet:** The most widely used browser wallet for Ethereum-compatible chains
- **Remix IDE:** An intuitive, browser-based Solidity development environment
- **Hardhat and Truffle:** Command-line developer tools for advanced workflows
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts:** Battle-tested, secure smart contract templates

### Step 1: MetaMask Setup for Zilliqa EVM

1. Install MetaMask if you have not already
2. Add a new network with the following details:
   - Network Name: Zilliqa EVM
   - RPC URL: https://api.zilliqa.com
   - Chain ID: 32769
   - Currency Symbol: ZIL
   - Block Explorer URL: [To be configured]
3. Switch to the Zilliqa EVM network inside MetaMask

### Step 2: Obtain Testnet ZIL

- Use official faucets linked in the developer portal or community channels
- Provide your MetaMask wallet address on Zilliqa EVM testnet to receive free test ZIL
- Confirm receipt in your wallet before proceeding

### Step 3: Deploy Simple Contracts with Remix

- Write or import sample Solidity contracts
- Compile and deploy on Zilliqa EVM testnet connected via MetaMask
- Interact with your deployed contracts and observe state changes
- Use the Zilliqa block explorer to verify transactions and contract status
