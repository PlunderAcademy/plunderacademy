## Ethereum: The Pioneer Programmable Blockchain

Ethereum introduced the concept of programmable smart contracts running on a distributed virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It has built the largest ecosystem of decentralized applications, tools, and developer communities. However, Ethereum faces significant challenges, including limited transaction throughput, resulting in network congestion, slower transaction finality, and high gas fees during peak demand periods.

## Zilliqa 2.0: EVM Compatibility with Scalability Enhancements

Zilliqa 2.0 maintains full compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing developers to reuse familiar tools, languages like Solidity, and deployment workflows. The critical improvement is Zilliqa's implementation of sharding, where the network splits itself into multiple parallel processing shards that handle transactions simultaneously.

### Key Advantages of Zilliqa

- Processes thousands of transactions per second, far surpassing Ethereum's legacy throughput
- Delivers faster transaction finality
- Significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum
- Ideal for developers seeking a high-performance EVM platform

## Developer Experience and Ecosystem

For Ethereum developers, moving to Zilliqa means leveraging existing knowledge of EVM, Solidity, and Ethereum tooling, such as Remix, Hardhat, and OpenZeppelin, with minimal adaptation. Zilliqa's compatibility lowers the learning curve and accelerates time to market for smart contracts and dApps.
