title: 'Bringing It All Together: Your First Real Contract'
objective: >-
  Create a complete SimpleBank contract implementing deposits, withdrawals, and
  event logging.
practicalTakeaway: >-
  Hands-on projects like SimpleBank bridge the gap between theory and practice,
  deepening understanding of real-world contract development workflows, gas
  management, and user interactions.

## Project Assignment

Create SimpleBank contract implementing:

- User deposits and withdrawals of ZIL
- Tracking balances with a `mapping(address => uint)`
- Withdrawal allowed only if the user has sufficient balance
- Emitting events on deposits and withdrawals for auditability
- Deploy the contract on Zilliqa EVM testnet using Remix IDE
- Use MetaMask to test deposits and withdrawals interactively

### Sample Implementation

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleBank {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    event Deposit(address indexed user, uint amount);
    event Withdrawal(address indexed user, uint amount);
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```
