## Introduction

Solidity is the primary programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and all EVM-compatible blockchains, including Zilliqa. It is statically typed and contract-oriented. Solidity's syntax draws inspiration from JavaScript and C++ but is specifically designed for secure and deterministic execution in decentralized environments.

### Structure of a Solidity Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    string public greeting = "Hello, Zilliqa!";
    
    function setGreeting(string calldata _greeting) public {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }
}
```

- `contract HelloWorld { ... }` defines the contract as a class-like blueprint
- `string public greeting` declares a state variable stored permanently on-chain
- The `setGreeting` function allows external users to update the greeting

### Key Solidity Types

- **uint:** Unsigned integer for non-negative whole numbers
- **address:** Blockchain account identifier, used for contracts or external users
- **bool:** Boolean logic true or false
- **string:** Text data encoded in UTF-8
