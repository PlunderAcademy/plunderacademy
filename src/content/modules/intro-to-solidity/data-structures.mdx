## Structs

Group related data fields:

```solidity
struct Person {
    string name;
    uint age;
}
```

## Arrays

Lists of data:

```solidity
Person[] public people;
```

You can add, remove, or iterate over arrays to manage collections.

## Mappings

Key-value stores resembling hash maps:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint) public balances;
```

Mappings efficiently store associations like user balances or permissions.

### Interactive Assignment

Expand HelloWorld to hold personalized greetings per user:

```solidity
mapping(address => string) public greetings;
```
