"Every interface is a doorway. Some are traps."

The Cipher Vault glows beneath layers of encrypted light.  
Doors within doors, each testing your intent.  

You learn to verify.  
Providers become suspects. Addresses demand proof.  
Metadata arrives cloaked in malice.  

Here, every click is a question.  
Every transaction, a test of trust.  

The vault opens only for those who check twice.
