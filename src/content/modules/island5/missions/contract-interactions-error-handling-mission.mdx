"In the city of neon, even code eats."

The Sushi Joint hums with color and sound.  
Every table serves a new creation.  

Metadata becomes flavor.  
You store art in IPFS and weave royalties into every dish.  
Mint phases rise and fall like orders through the night.  

Each recipe is logic. Each bite, a contract.
