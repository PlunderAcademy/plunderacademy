## The Role of Gas

Gas quantifies computational effort and resource usage on the EVM. By attaching a cost to every executed operation, it prevents wasteful or malicious consumption of network resources. Users must pay gas fees to incentivize miners or validators to include and execute their transactions.

### Gas Costs and Pricing Mechanics

EVM instructions have predefined gas costs proportional to their computation and storage demands. More complex operations and writes to storage require significantly more gas. Before execution, users specify:

- **Gas Price:** Payment per unit of gas, influencing transaction inclusion priority
- **Gas Limit:** Upper gas expenditure bound protecting users from unexpectedly high fees

### Gas Payments on Zilliqa

Zilliqa's native token ZIL is used to pay fees. Its scalable design keeps typical gas prices low, facilitating affordable and rapid dApp interactions.
