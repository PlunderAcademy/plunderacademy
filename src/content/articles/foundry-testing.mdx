## Beyond Unit Tests

Combine fuzzing and invariants to explore unexpected states and ensure key properties hold.

- Unit: narrow behavior
- Fuzz: random inputs
- Invariant: global properties across time

```bash
# forge test -vvvv
# Invariants validate properties across sequences of calls
```

### Stateful Fuzzing

Model complex actors with handlers to explore multi-step attacks and integrations.
