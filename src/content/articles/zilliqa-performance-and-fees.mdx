## Performance & Fees

Design with throughput and finality in mind. Batch operations and tune storage patterns to reduce costs.

- Amortize expensive writes.
- Use events for indexing off-chain.
- Prefer pull over push where possible.

### Observability

Budget gas and storage, track usage over time, and alert on regressions.
