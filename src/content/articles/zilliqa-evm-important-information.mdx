This guide summarizes the essentials for building on Zilliqa 2: which networks are available, where to point your EVM tooling, how to browse on-chain data, and where to grab test funds. Keep this page handy when wiring up your RPC client, wallet, or indexer.


## Networks & RPC Endpoints

Zilliqa operates multiple public networks so you can separate production deployments from testing and development. Below are the headline details developers reach for most often (chain ID and a representative RPC endpoint).

### Mainnet

- **Chain ID:** 32769
- **API (RPC):** [api.zilliqa.com](https://api.zilliqa.com) (EVM-compatible)

### Testnet

- **Chain ID:** 33101
- **API (RPC):** [api.testnet.zilliqa.com](https://api.testnet.zilliqa.com/)

**Tip:** Many wallets and frameworks can auto-configure from [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org). Zilliqa 2 network entries are published there for quick setup.

## Block Explorers

Use an explorer to inspect blocks, transactions, logs, contract code, and token metadata. Choose the one that best fits your workflow or UI preferences:

### Blockscout

- [Mainnet](http://zilliqa.blockscout.com)
- [Testnet](http://testnet.zilliqa.blockscout.com)

### EVMX

- [Mainnet](https://evmx.zilliqa.com)
- [Testnet](https://evmx.testnet.zilliqa.com)

### Otterscan

- [Mainnet](https://otterscan.zilliqa.com)
- [Testnet](https://otterscan.testnet.zilliqa.com)

### ViewBlock

- [Mainnet](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa?network=mainnet)
- [Testnet](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa?network=testnet)

## Faucets (Test Funds)

For integration testing, you can request small amounts of ZIL on non-production chains:

- **Testnet faucet:** [faucet.testnet.zilliqa.com](https://faucet.testnet.zilliqa.com)

The faucet typically sends 100 ZIL to the EVM address you provide — enough for contract deploys, swaps on test DEXes, and scripted test runs.

## Developer Notes & Best Practices

- **Prefer EVM tooling:** With Zilliqa 2's EVM compatibility, standard stacks (Hardhat, Foundry, web3/viem, MetaMask) work with the endpoints above. This keeps your pipeline consistent across chains.
- **Pin versions & RPCs:** In CI, pin the network (chain ID) and explicit RPC URLs so deploy scripts are deterministic.
- **Use multiple explorers:** If you're debugging traces/logs, try a second explorer for a different presentation of the same on-chain data.
- **Mind rate limits:** Public RPCs are shared. For production services, consider running your own node or a managed endpoint to ensure throughput and reliability.

### Quick Setup Example

```javascript
// viem configuration for Zilliqa testnet
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem';

const zilliqaTestnet = {
  id: 33101,
  name: 'Zilliqa Testnet',
  network: 'zilliqa-testnet',
  nativeCurrency: { name: 'Zilliqa', symbol: 'ZIL', decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: { http: ['https://api.testnet.zilliqa.com'] },
    public: { http: [' https://api.testnet.zilliqa.com'] },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: { name: 'Otterscan', url: 'https://otterscan.testnet.zilliqa.com' },
  },
};

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: zilliqaTestnet,
  transport: http(),
});
```

## Next Steps

Once you have your development environment configured with the correct endpoints:

1. **Connect your wallet** to Zilliqa testnet using MetaMask
2. **Get test ZIL** from the faucet for gas fees
3. **Deploy a simple contract** to verify your setup
4. **Explore transactions** in your preferred block explorer

Always verify endpoints and chain IDs against the [official Zilliqa Dev Portal](https://dev.zilliqa.com/zilliqa2/endpoints/), as infrastructure can evolve with new releases.
