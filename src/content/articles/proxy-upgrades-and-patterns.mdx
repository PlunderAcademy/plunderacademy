## Proxy Patterns

Choose between Transparent and UUPS based on trust and flexibility. Guard upgradeability with access control and timelocks.

![Proxy pattern diagram](/articles/proxy-upgrades.svg)

- Prevent storage collisions with fixed slots (EIP-1967).
- Comprehensive upgrade tests and simulations.

```solidity
// EIP-1967 implementation slot example
bytes32 constant IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894...;
```

### Governance

Define clear upgrade owners, timelocks, and emergency procedures.
