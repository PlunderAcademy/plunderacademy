Zilliqa has long been known for its **pioneering sharding technology**, enabling the blockchain to scale transactions far beyond most of its competitors. But for years, one challenge stood in the way of rapid adoption: developers had to learn a brand-new smart contract language, **Scilla**.

Scilla is powerful and secure, but it isn't what most blockchain developers already know. That's where **Solidity support on Zilliqa** comes in — and why it could be the spark that accelerates Zilliqa's ecosystem growth.


## Why Solidity Matters

- **Industry standard**: Solidity is the primary smart contract language on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. Millions of developers already know it.
- **Tooling ecosystem**: Frameworks like **Hardhat**, **Truffle**, and **Foundry** revolve around Solidity.
- **Talent pipeline**: Universities, coding bootcamps, and tutorials teach Solidity first, making it the entry point for most blockchain devs.

By bringing Solidity to Zilliqa, the network lowers the barrier for adoption dramatically. A developer who already knows how to deploy on Ethereum can now deploy on Zilliqa with minimal changes.

## How Zilliqa Implements Solidity

Zilliqa introduced **EVM compatibility** — meaning it can interpret Solidity contracts without requiring developers to rewrite their code in Scilla.

This unlocks:

- **Cross-chain deployment**: Port an Ethereum dApp to Zilliqa with few modifications.
- **Broader tooling**: Use familiar tools like **Metamask** and **Hardhat** to test and deploy.
- **Interoperability**: dApps that were previously Ethereum-only can now expand to Zilliqa's ecosystem.

Here's a simple Solidity example that can run on Zilliqa's EVM:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract TreasureChest {
    address public captain;
    uint256 public totalDeposits;
    mapping(address => uint256) public contributions;
    
    event GoldDeposited(address indexed contributor, uint256 amount);
    event GoldWithdrawn(address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);
    
    error OnlyCaptain();
    error InsufficientGold(uint256 requested, uint256 available);
    error TransferFailed();
    error ZeroAmount();

    constructor() payable {
        captain = msg.sender;
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            totalDeposits = msg.value;
            contributions[msg.sender] = msg.value;
            emit GoldDeposited(msg.sender, msg.value);
        }
    }

    modifier onlyCaptain() {
        if (msg.sender != captain) revert OnlyCaptain();
        _;
    }

    function plunder() external payable {
        if (msg.value == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
        
        totalDeposits += msg.value;
        contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        emit GoldDeposited(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

    function loot(uint256 amount) external onlyCaptain {
        if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
        
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance < amount) revert InsufficientGold(amount, balance);
        
        totalDeposits -= amount;
        
        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
        if (!success) revert TransferFailed();
        
        emit GoldWithdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function getBalance() external view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```

This contract could be deployed on Ethereum, Polygon… or now, Zilliqa.

## Why It's a Game-Changer for Adoption

### 1. Lower Barrier to Entry
Developers don't have to learn Scilla before shipping on Zilliqa. They can start with the Solidity they already know.

### 2. Bigger Talent Pool
Startups and projects can hire from the vast Solidity developer market, instead of searching for the niche skill of Scilla.

### 3. Faster Ecosystem Growth
More developers = more dApps = more users. Ecosystems thrive when building is frictionless.

### 4. Improved Interoperability
dApps can go multi-chain more easily, choosing Zilliqa for its scalability and cost benefits.

## The Strategic Transformation

### From Scilla to Solidity

In the early days, Zilliqa championed **Scilla** as its native smart contract language, with a focus on safety and formal verification. While Scilla was powerful, it created a barrier for developers who had to learn an entirely new syntax and ecosystem. Today, Scilla has officially moved to **legacy status**, and the future of Zilliqa development is firmly anchored in **Solidity**.

This shift is not just a technical upgrade — it's a strategic move. By aligning fully with Solidity, Zilliqa positions itself to capture the vast developer market already building on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. New projects can port over with minimal changes, and existing Solidity talent can onboard instantly without friction.

### Real-World Evidence

We are already seeing this transition play out in the ecosystem:

- **Decentralized exchanges** such as [PlunderSwap](https://plunderswap.com) are being built entirely in Solidity, offering familiar workflows for developers and traders alike.
- **Innovative platforms** like [Kalijo](https://kalijo.io) are choosing Solidity as the foundation for their contracts, ensuring long-term compatibility with the broader Web3 ecosystem.
- **Identity solutions** like [ZilNames](https://zilnames.com) leverage standard ENS patterns, making integration seamless for existing dApps.

By standardizing on Solidity, Zilliqa is no longer asking developers to choose between security and adoption. Instead, it's opening the floodgates for a new wave of decentralized applications — from DeFi protocols and NFTs to gaming and metaverse projects — all leveraging the scalability and performance of the Zilliqa blockchain, without the learning curve of a bespoke language.

## Developer Benefits

### Immediate Advantages

- **Familiar syntax**: Use the same language patterns you know from Ethereum
- **Existing toolchain**: Hardhat, Foundry, OpenZeppelin work out of the box
- **Code reusability**: Port existing contracts with minimal changes
- **Community support**: Tap into the vast Solidity developer community

### Long-term Strategic Value

- **Career portability**: Skills transfer across EVM ecosystems
- **Faster development**: No need to learn new language fundamentals

## The Future: 100% Solidity-Powered

In short: the future of Zilliqa is **100% Solidity-powered**. For developers, this means:

- **Faster builds** with familiar tools and patterns
- **Smoother onboarding** without language learning curves  
- **Access to a thriving ecosystem** of tools and frameworks that have already been battle-tested across the Web3 landscape
- **Immediate productivity** leveraging existing Solidity knowledge

This transformation positions Zilliqa not just as a faster blockchain, but as the **most developer-friendly** high-performance EVM chain — combining the scalability benefits of sharding with the accessibility of Solidity.
