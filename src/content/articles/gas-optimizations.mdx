## Gas: Focus on Hot Paths

Optimize code that runs often or in tight loops. Prefer clarity unless a hotspot warrants change.

![Gas optimization themes](/articles/gas-optimizations.svg)

- Pack storage and minimize SSTORE writes.
- Use unchecked arithmetic when safe.
- Avoid redundant external calls; cache values.

```solidity
unchecked { ++i; } // when overflows are impossible
bytes32 slot = keccak256(abi.encode(key, base)); // computed once
```
