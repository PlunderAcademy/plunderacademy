Zilliqa operates across two execution environments: the legacy Scilla side and the EVM (Ethereum-compatible) side. This guide explains how your wallet addresses work on both sides, what "receive-only twin" addresses are, how to move assets safely, and how Scilla-native ZRC-2 tokens become usable on EVM via proxy contracts.

## Zilliqa's Two Execution Environments

- **Scilla (Legacy)**: Uses `zil1...` addresses and the Scilla smart-contract language.
- **Zilliqa EVM**: Uses `0x...` addresses and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. You can use any EVM-compatible wallet like MetaMask, Rabby, or WalletConnect-enabled wallets to interact with Zilliqa EVM.

You typically control both sides with the same private key, resulting in two primary addresses.

## Your Two Operating Addresses

- **Main Scilla address**: Your `zil1...` address for Scilla-side transactions and Scilla dApps.
- **Main EVM address**: Your `0x...` address for EVM-compatible dApps on Zilliqa EVM - the same format used in MetaMask, Rabby, or any other EVM wallet.

## Receive-Only "Twin" Representations

Each main address has a "twin" representation on the other side, used strictly as a receiving destination:

- Your main `zil1...` (Scilla) address has a corresponding `0x` twin representation.
  - **Purpose**: Destination address when sending assets to your Scilla wallet from the EVM side.
  - **Limitation**: Cannot initiate EVM transactions.
- Your main `0x...` (EVM) address has a corresponding `zil1` twin representation.
  - **Purpose**: Destination address when sending assets to your EVM wallet from the Scilla side or from centralized exchanges (Binance, KuCoin) that use `zil1` addresses for Zilliqa withdrawals.
  - **Limitation**: Cannot initiate Scilla transactions.

Twins function as receive-only mailboxes - they accept incoming tokens but cannot send outbound transactions.

## The Golden Rule

- To transact on Scilla, use your **main `zil1...`** address.
- To transact on EVM, use your **main `0x...`** address.

Twins are receive-only - do not attempt to use them for dApp interactions or outbound transfers.

### Practical Example

Here's how the address relationships work in practice:

```
Your Main Addresses (for transactions):
  Main Scilla:  zil1abc123...xyz789
  Main EVM:     0x123def...456abc

Receive-Only Twin Addresses:
  0x twin of your Scilla address: 0x789ghi...012jkl
    (used as destination when sending TO Scilla FROM EVM)
  
  zil1 twin of your EVM address: zil1mno456...pqr890
    (used as destination when sending TO EVM FROM Scilla or CEX)
```

You can only initiate transactions from your main addresses, never from twins.

## Moving Assets Between Sides

### From Scilla (`zil1`) to EVM (`0x`)
1. Send ZIL or ZRC-2 tokens from your main `zil1...` address.
2. Use the **`zil1` twin of your `0x` EVM address** as the destination.
3. Assets will be associated with your main `0x...` address on EVM.

### From EVM (`0x`) to Scilla (`zil1`)
1. Send ZIL from your main `0x...` EVM address.
2. Use the **`0x` twin of your `zil1` address** as the destination.
3. Assets will appear under your main `zil1...` address on Scilla.

### From Centralized Exchanges (CEX)
Most centralized exchanges (Binance, KuCoin, etc.) use `zil1...` format for Zilliqa withdrawals:
- To receive in your **Scilla wallet**: Use your main `zil1...` address.
- To receive in your **EVM wallet**: Use the `zil1` twin of your `0x...` EVM address.

> Note: ZRC-2 token flows from EVM back to Scilla are handled at the protocol/bridge level. Always verify token type, destination format, and fees before sending.

## Using Scilla-Native ZRC-2 Tokens on EVM

Scilla-native tokens (ZRC-2) become usable on EVM through dedicated proxy contracts:

1. Send the ZRC-2 token from your Scilla wallet (main `zil1...`) to the **`zil1` twin** of your EVM wallet.
2. The token is represented on EVM through a specific **proxy contract** (`0x...` address).
3. Add the proxy address as a custom token in your EVM wallet to see your balance and interact with EVM dApps.

## Adding ZRC-2 Proxy Tokens to Your Wallet

1. Find the EVM proxy contract address for your token in the tables below.
2. In your EVM wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.), select "Add token" or "Import token."
3. Paste the proxy `0x...` address. The wallet auto-populates token details.
4. Confirm to see your balance and use with EVM dApps.

> Important: Only use proxy addresses that you trust. Unvetted proxies may not represent real assets.

## Critical Warnings

- Never send EVM-native ERC-20 tokens to a `zil1...` Scilla address. They will be lost.
- Use your main addresses for transactions; twins are receive-only.
- Confirm token type (ZIL, ZRC-2, ERC-20), destination format (`zil1` vs `0x`), and fees before sending.

## Quick Reference

- **Transact on Scilla**: Use main `zil1...` address
- **Transact on EVM**: Use main `0x...` address
- **Receive from Scilla to EVM**: Use the `zil1` twin of your `0x` address
- **Receive from EVM to Scilla**: Use the `0x` twin of your `zil1` address
- **Use ZRC-2 tokens on EVM**: Add the token's proxy contract as a custom token

## Wallet Options

### EVM-Only Wallets (MetaMask, Rabby, WalletConnect)

Standard EVM wallets like MetaMask, Rabby, or any WalletConnect-enabled wallet can be used for Zilliqa EVM:
- Simply add the Zilliqa EVM network to your wallet configuration.
- These wallets will only display and use your `0x...` EVM address.
- To interact with Scilla-side assets or move funds between sides, you'll need to manually manage address conversions and understand the twin address system described above.

### Dual-Support Wallets (Torch)

Wallets like Torch Browser Wallet support both Scilla and Zilliqa EVM from a single private key:

- **EVM Mode**: Displays and uses your **main `0x...` EVM address**.
- **Scilla Mode**: Displays and uses your **main `zil1...` Scilla address**.

These wallets automatically switch between addresses based on your selected network. Twin addresses work behind the scenes for cross-side transfers.
