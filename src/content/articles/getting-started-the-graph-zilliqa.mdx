If you've deployed a smart contract on **Zilliqa 2.0** and want fast, structured access to its on-chain data, **The Graph** makes it simple.  
In this guide, you’ll create and deploy your first **subgraph**, showing how **PlunderSwap** can index and query swap events from its liquidity pool contracts.

---

## ⚙️ What You’ll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to:

1. Install and configure the Graph CLI  
2. Initialize a subgraph for a Zilliqa contract  
3. Define entities and mappings  
4. Deploy the subgraph to The Graph’s hosted service  
5. Run GraphQL queries to access indexed data  

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Node.js ≥ 16**  
- **npm** or **yarn**  
- A deployed **Zilliqa smart contract** (e.g. a PlunderSwap Pool Factory)  
- A **GitHub account** and an **access token** from [The Graph Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/)  

---

## ⚓ Step 1 – Install the Graph CLI

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

Verify installation:

```bash
graph --version
```

---

## 🧭 Step 2 – Initialize a Subgraph for Zilliqa

Run this command to scaffold your project:

```bash
graph init   --product hosted-service   --from-contract 0xYourPlunderSwapContract   --network zilliqa   plunderswap/plunderswap-subgraph
```

This creates a project structure like the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>subgraph.yaml</code></td>
      <td>Manifest describing data sources and events to index.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>schema.graphql</code></td>
      <td>Data model for your entities.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>src/mapping.ts</code></td>
      <td>Logic that transforms blockchain events into entities.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

---

## 🧩 Step 3 – Define Entities

Open `schema.graphql` and define a simple entity for PlunderSwap swap events:

```graphql
type Swap @entity {
  id: ID!
  trader: Bytes!
  tokenIn: Bytes!
  tokenOut: Bytes!
  amountIn: BigInt!
  amountOut: BigInt!
  timestamp: BigInt!
}
```

Each entity represents a record stored by The Graph indexer.

---

## ⚙️ Step 4 – Map Events to Entities

In `src/mapping.ts`, import your contract events and save them to the schema:

```ts
import { Swap as SwapEvent } from "../generated/PlunderSwap/PlunderSwap";
import { Swap } from "../generated/schema";

export function handleSwap(event: SwapEvent): void {
  let entity = new Swap(event.transaction.hash.toHex());
  entity.trader = event.params.trader;
  entity.tokenIn = event.params.tokenIn;
  entity.tokenOut = event.params.tokenOut;
  entity.amountIn = event.params.amountIn;
  entity.amountOut = event.params.amountOut;
  entity.timestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  entity.save();
}
```

Every time a `Swap` event occurs on Zilliqa, Graphnode executes this function to store the data.

---

## 🚀 Step 5 – Deploy the Subgraph

Authenticate and deploy:

```bash
graph auth --product hosted-service <ACCESS_TOKEN>
graph deploy --product hosted-service plunderswap/plunderswap-subgraph
```

Once deployed, you’ll receive a GraphQL endpoint such as:

```
https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/plunderswap/plunderswap-subgraph
```

---

## 🔍 Step 6 – Query Your Data

Use the GraphQL Playground or a client library to query indexed swap data:

```graphql
{
  swaps(first: 5, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
    trader
    tokenIn
    tokenOut
    amountIn
    amountOut
    timestamp
  }
}
```

The response will return structured PlunderSwap data from the Zilliqa blockchain — ready for dashboards or analytics.

---

## 🧠 Recap

- **Graphnode** handles indexing automatically once configured.  
- A **subgraph** defines which contract data to index.  
- With Zilliqa’s EVM support, The Graph can now power rich analytics for Zilliqa dApps.  
- The deployed GraphQL endpoint becomes a real-time data API for your project.  

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- Add additional event handlers for `Mint` and `Burn` events.  
- Integrate the GraphQL endpoint into your analytics dashboard.  
- Explore advanced mapping features such as derived fields and batching.
