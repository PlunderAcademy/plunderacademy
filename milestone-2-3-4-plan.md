## ✅ Interactive Element Types (COMPLETED - Milestone 2)

All 5 new interactive element types have been successfully implemented with dual-mode architecture for both learning and assessment use cases.

### Implementation Status: COMPLETE

**Completed Elements:**

1. ✅ Word Jumble - Unscramble blockchain terminology
2. ✅ Concept Matching - Drag concepts to match definitions
3. ✅ Timeline Builder - Arrange events chronologically
4. ✅ True/False Statements - Classify statements (3-column drag-drop)
5. ✅ Drag & Drop Code Puzzle - Arrange code blocks in correct order
6. ✅ Deploy Challenge - Already implemented (Module 5)
7. ✅ Traditional Quiz - Now supports mixed question types

### Dual-Mode Architecture (IMPLEMENTED)

All elements support both learning (with feedback) and assessment (quiz validation) modes:

- **Learning Mode**: Immediate feedback, unlimited retries, hints, explanations
- **Assessment Mode**: No feedback, blue/neutral colors, captures structured JSON for API grading
- **Security**: Quiz MDX files don't expose correct answers in source code
- **Partial Credit**: Backend can award points based on correctness percentage

### Integration Complete

- **Lesson Integration**: MDX components available (`<WordJumble />`, `<ConceptMatching />`, etc.)
- **Quiz Integration**: Mixed with traditional multiple choice in quiz MDX files
- **API Format**: Standardized JSON submission format for all element types
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs in `src/components/interactive-elements/README.md`

### Deployed in Module 1 Quizzes

All 4 quizzes in Island 1 now include at least one interactive element:

- blockchain-fundamentals-quiz: Word Jumble
- evm-fundamentals-quiz: Concept Matching  
- intro-to-solidity-quiz: Timeline Builder
- zilliqa-evm-setup-quiz: True/False + Drag-Drop Puzzle

See `README.md` for detailed usage documentation and API formats.

### Technical Implementation Details

For complete implementation documentation, see:

- `README.md` - Overview and usage examples
- `src/components/interactive-elements/README.md` - Detailed technical docs
- Quiz MDX files in `src/content/modules/island1/quizzes/` - Live examples

### API Submission Format

All interactive element answers are submitted as stringified JSON within the quiz answers object:

```typescript
{
  walletAddress: "0x...",
  achievementNumber: "1",
  submissionType: "quiz",
  submissionData: {
    answers: {
      "q1": "B",  // Traditional
      "q2": "A,C,D",  // Traditional
      "q3": "{\"type\":\"word-jumble\",\"userResponse\":{\"word\":\"BLOCKCHAIN\"}}",  // Interactive
      "q4": "{\"type\":\"concept-matching\",\"userResponse\":{\"pairs\":[...]}}"  // Interactive
    }
  },
  metadata: { timestamp: "...", timeSpent: 456 }
}
```

Backend detects JSON-formatted answers and parses them for grading. See README for complete grading pseudocode.
